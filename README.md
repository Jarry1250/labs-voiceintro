"Pronunciation Recording" is an extension for MediaWiki which provides a User-Friendly interface to upload the pronunciation of a word. The extension is initially made keeping the Wiktionary Community in mind and to the millions of people using this online free dictionary. In future this extension can be used for spoken articles too.

This Extension uses RecorderJS library written originally by Matt Diamond with modifications by Chris Wilson. The RecorderJS library is under the MIT License. For more information about the library visit:
